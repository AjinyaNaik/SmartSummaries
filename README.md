Smart Summaries - AI-Powered Medical Documentation

Overview

In the fast-paced medical field, physicians often struggle to keep up with documentation due to time constraints. Smart Summaries is an AI-powered tool designed to simplify how doctors capture and review patient interactions. By leveraging speech-to-text technology, optical character recognition (OCR), and predictive analytics, this project aims to automate routine documentation, ensuring that critical details are accurately recorded while reducing the administrative burden on healthcare professionals.

Features

Speech-to-Text Summarization: Automatically transcribes and organizes patient-physician conversations, capturing essential details such as symptoms, diagnoses, treatments, and follow-up plans.

OCR for Medical Reports: Extracts and summarizes key information from medical documents, converting complex reports into easy-to-read insights.

Predictive Analytics (Planned Feature): Provides data-driven insights into diagnoses, treatments, and therapies to support well-informed clinical decisions.

User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive design that integrates seamlessly with existing medical workflows, ensuring ease of use for healthcare professionals.

Secure & Compliant: Ensures patient data privacy and compliance with medical standards such as HIPAA.
